## About
After completing the course I decided to re-review the Term 1 section on
Python Programming to refresh my skills, and further commit to memory the
concepts learned. This file serves as a one-stop source for all of my notes
on Python Programming and the lessons and quizzes taken.

To run the file on your local machine

1. Download or clone the repository onto your machine.
2. Extract the .zip file.
3. Open udacity_python_notes.py file in your Text Editor or favorite Python IDE.
5. I don't recommend you try to run every bit of code in this file at once.  
I found it best to read thru the lessons, and copy/paste code into the terminal
while running Python.
6. I also included the downloaded individual quiz files.
